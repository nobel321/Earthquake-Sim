# Earthquake Simulator
The program simulates a mini earthquake using user inputs of earthquake magnitude, duration, fault type, and epicenter location. It calculates secondary effects such as energy released, Richter scale magnitude, and Mercalli scale intensity. The earthquake is then visualized using Pygame in a top-down view, with the epicenter represented by a red dot and the shockwave represented by a black line expanding outwards. The program also includes a simple terminal animation of the earthquake simulation.

ðŸ”´ = Epicenter
â¬› = Fault line

## Key Vocabulary:
- **Fault Type** - fracture or zone of fractures between 2 blocks of rock; several types, including: strike-slip, normal, and reverse (thurst) faults
- **Epicenter** - the point on the Earth's surface directly above the hypocenter or focus, where an earthquake or underground explosion originates.
